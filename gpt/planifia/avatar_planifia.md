Half-length vertical portrait of a 22-year-old Latin American man, depicted as a modern and energetic project planner. He has light brown skin with warm undertones, short black hair slightly messy from working, and bright, focused brown eyes. His expression is friendly, confident, and strategic — reflecting quick thinking and leadership in fast-paced environments. He wears a casual yet professional outfit: a plain dark hoodie layered over a light grey T-shirt, with the hoodie sleeves lightly rolled to the elbows. In his left hand, he holds a large open roadmap notebook filled with colorful sticky notes, some with small doodles and arrows. In his right hand, he holds a black pen as if ready to mark tasks. The background is clean and bright white, studio-lit with soft neutral lighting. Photorealistic, ultra-sharp detail, vertical composition (not square), matching the lighting and framing style of the other AI assistant portraits (Quiliano, Magnus, Alan, Ada, Leonardo, Eleanor). No logos, no text, no technology brand names, no fantastical elements — keep the style grounded in reality.
